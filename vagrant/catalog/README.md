## About

This is a simple CRUD application that uses [**Flask**](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [**OAuth2**](https://oauth.net/2/) to allow authenticated users to create, read, update and destroy catalog objects.

A `User` object is automatically created when a user logins via a third party authentication service. The third-party service used in this application is [**Google**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2), so users of this application will need a [**Google**](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en) account to create/edit/destroy objects.

The two types of objects `Users` can create, update, and destroy are: `Category` and `Item` objects:

### Category
    class Category(Base):
        id          # automatically incremented integer
        name        # string for name of object
        slug        # formatted version of name used to access object by name via URL
        user_id     # integer referring to the user that created the object
        user        # relationship to user
        created     # datetime when object was created
        updated     # datetime when object was last updated
### Item
    class Item(Base):
        id          # automatically incremented integer
        name        # string for name of object
        description # description of object
        category_id # integer referring to parent category
        category    # relationship to parent category
        slug        # formatted version of name used to access object by name via URL
        user_id     # integer referring to the user that created the object
        user        # relationship to user
        created     # datetime when object was created
        updated     # datetime when object was last updated
        
These objects are accessed via the following route patterns:
